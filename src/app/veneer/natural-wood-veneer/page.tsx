      faqs={[
        { q: "What is the difference between Crown Cut and Quarter Cut veneer?", a: "Crown Cut (also called flat cut) is sliced through the centre of the log, producing the characteristic arch or 'cathedral' grain pattern. Quarter Cut is sliced at right angles to the growth rings, producing a straighter, more consistent grain pattern." },
        { q: "Are SharonPly veneers sustainably sourced?", a: "Yes. All our veneers come from FSC-certified supply chains, ensuring responsible forest management practices. Veneer also makes highly efficient use of premium timber — one log can yield hundreds of veneer sheets." },
        { q: "What species are available?", a: "Standard availability: Teak, Walnut, Oak, Maple, Cherry. Additional species including Rosewood, Sapele, Ash, Beech, and exotic species available on request for bulk orders." },
        { q: "Do I need paper-backed veneer or raw?", a: "Paper-backed veneer is recommended for most applications — easier to handle, less prone to splitting, and better adhesion with standard contact adhesives. Raw veneer is used by specialist craftsmen for marquetry, inlay work, and curved surfaces." },
        { q: "What adhesive should I use?", a: "Standard contact adhesive (solvent or water-based) works well for most applications. For curved work, use flexible adhesive. PVA woodworking glue with a veneer press or caul boards is ideal for flat panel work." },
