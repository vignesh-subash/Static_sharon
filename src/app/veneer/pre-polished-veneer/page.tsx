      faqs={[
        { q: "What is the difference between UV lacquer and PU coating?", a: "UV lacquer is cured instantly under UV light, producing a very hard, durable surface with excellent scratch and chemical resistance. PU (polyurethane) coating is air-dried and produces a slightly more flexible finish with a warmer look. Both are high-quality factory finishes significantly better than site-applied alternatives." },
        { q: "Can pre-polished veneer panels be cut on site?", a: "Yes, pre-polished panels can be cut with standard woodworking saws. Cut edges will be unfinished and should be edge-banded with matching PVC or wood edge tape for a clean finish." },
        { q: "What sheen level should I choose?", a: "Matte (5–10%) works best for contemporary and understated interiors — it hides fingerprints and small imperfections. Satin (30–40%) is the most versatile and popular choice. High Gloss (80–90%) creates a premium, dramatic effect but requires careful maintenance." },
        { q: "Is site polishing completely unnecessary?", a: "Yes. Pre-polished panels are factory-finished to final quality. No additional sealing, sanding, or polishing is required. Simply install, edge-band cut edges, and the job is done." },
        { q: "What substrates are available?", a: "Standard options: 6mm and 9mm MDF-backed panels, 12mm and 18mm plywood-backed panels. Custom substrates and thicknesses available for bulk orders." },
