        { q: "What makes BWP doors different from MR doors?", a: "BWP (Boiling Water Proof) doors use phenol-formaldehyde resin bonding and pass the boiling water test per IS:2202. MR doors use urea-formaldehyde resin suitable for dry interiors only. BWP doors are required for bathrooms, kitchens, and any moisture-prone areas." },
        { q: "Are Sovereign BWP doors suitable for exterior use?", a: "Sovereign BWP Doors are suitable for interior and semi-exterior applications. They withstand moisture, steam, and humidity effectively. For fully exposed exterior doors facing direct rain and UV, additional surface protection (paint or laminate) is recommended." },
        { q: "What sizes are available?", a: "Standard sizes: 6'6\"×2'6\", 6'6\"×2'9\", 7'×3', 7'×3'3\". Thickness: 30mm, 32mm, 35mm. Custom sizes available for bulk orders." },
